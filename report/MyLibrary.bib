This overview provides technical and historical pointers to the field, and surveys current applications of deep learning to biomedical data organized around five subareas, roughly of increasing spatial scale: chemoinformatics, proteomics, genomics and transcriptomics, biomedical imaging, and health care.

The innovative content includes coverage of 99\% of RefSeq genes with multiple probes per gene, 96\% of CpG islands from the UCSC database, CpG island shores and additional content selected from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data and input from DNA methylation experts. The well-characterized Infinium\textregistered{} Assay is used for analysis of CpG methylation using bisulfite-converted genomic DNA. We applied this technology to analyze DNA methylation in normal and tumor DNA samples and compared results with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data obtained for the same samples. Highly comparable DNA methylation profiles were generated by the array and sequencing methods (average R2 of 0.95). The ability to determine genome-wide methylation patterns will rapidly advance methylation research.},

  abstract = {Background: Protein evolution gives rise to families of structurally related proteins, within which sequence identities can be extremely low. As a result, structure-based classifications can be effective at identifying unanticipated relationships in known structures and in optimal cases function can also be assigned. The ever increasing number of known protein structures is too large to classify all proteins manually, therefore, automatic methods are needed for fast evaluation of protein structures. Results: We present a semi-automatic procedure for deriving a novel hierarchical classification of protein domain structures (CATH). The four main levels of our classification are protein class (C), architecture (A), topology (T) and homologous superfamily (H). Class is the simplest level, and it essentially describes the secondary structure composition of each domain. In contrast, architecture summarises the shape revealed by the orientations of the secondary structure units, such as barrels and sandwiches. At the topology level, sequential connectivity is considered, such that members of the same architecture might have quite different topologies. When structures belonging to the same T-level have suitably high similarities combined with similar functions, the proteins are assumed to be evolutionarily related and put into the same homologous superfamily. Conclusions: Analysis of the structural families generated by CATH reveals the prominent features of protein structure space. We find that nearly a third of the homologous superfamilies (H-levels) belong to ten major T-levels, which we call superfolds, and furthermore that nearly two-thirds of these H-levels cluster into nine simple architectures. A database of well-characterised protein structure families, such as CATH, will facilitate the assignment of structure\textendash{}function/ evolution relationships to both known and newly determined protein structures.},

Probabilistic models are becoming increasingly important in analysing the huge amount of data being produced by large-scale DNA-sequencing efforts such as the Human Genome Project. For example, hidden Markov models are used for analysing biological sequences, linguistic-grammar-based probabilistic models for identifying RNA secondary structure, and probabilistic evolutionary models for inferring phylogenies of sequences from different organisms. This book gives a unified, up-to-date and self-contained account, with a Bayesian slant, of such methods, and more generally to probabilistic methods of sequence analysis. Written by an interdisciplinary team of authors, it aims to be accessible to molecular biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians with no formal knowledge of the other fields, and at the same time present the state-of-the-art in this new and highly important field.},

With the help of multiple activities, you'll learn concepts that show various stages of a file-from when it is untracked to when it is set for tracking under version control. As you make your way through the chapters, you'll learn to navigate through the history of a repository, fetch and deliver code to GitHub, and undo code changes. The first half of the book ends with you learning to work with branches, storing and retrieving changes temporarily, and merging the desired changes into a repository. In the second half, you'll learn about forking as part of a collaborative workflow. You'll also address modularity and duplication through submodules, tracing and rectifying faulty changes, and maintaining repositories. By the end of this book, you will have learned how to effectively deploy applications using GitHub. What you will learn Understand and implement best practices in version control Explain the GitHub User Interface Understand what is Feature Branch Workflow and implement its features Use forking features, such as submodules and rebasing Master commands for debugging and maintaining a repository Implement continuous integration with CircleCi or TravisCi Gain insight into release management and how GitHub enables software releases Who this book is for If you want to migrate from other version control tools or want to learn more about Git, Introduction to Git and GitHub is for you.

  abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans represents an excellent model in which to dissect the biosynthesis and assembly of the nematode cuticle. A sequenced genome, straightforward transgenesis, available mutants and practical genome-wide RNAi approaches provide an invaluable toolkit in the characterization of cuticle components. We have performed a targeted RNAi screen in an attempt to identify components of the cuticle collagen biosynthetic pathway. Collagen biosynthesis and cuticle assembly are multi-step processes that involve numerous key enzymes involved in post-translational modification, trimer folding, procollagen processing and subsequent cross-linking stages. For many of these steps, the modifications and the enzymes are unique to nematodes and may represent attractive targets for the control of parasitic nematodes. A novel serine protease inhibitor was uncovered during our targeted screen, which is involved in collagen maturation, proper cuticle assembly and the moulting process. We have confirmed a link between this inhibitor and the previously uncharacterised bli-5 locus in C. elegans. The mutant phenotype, spatial expression pattern and the over-expression phenotype of the BLI-5 protease inhibitor and their relevance to collagen biosynthesis are discussed.},

  abstract = {Databases of multiple sequence alignments are a valuable aid to protein sequence classification and analysis. One of the main challenges when constructing such a database is to simultaneously satisfy the conflicting demands of completeness on the one hand and quality of alignment and domain definitions on the other. The latter properties are best dealt with by manual approaches, whereas completeness in practice is only amenable to automatic methods. Herein we present a database based on hidden Markov model profiles (HMMs), which combines high quality and completeness. Our database, Pfam, consists of parts A and B. Pfam-A is curated and contains well-characterized protein domain families with high quality alignments, which are maintained by using manually checked seed alignments and HMMs to find and align all members. Pfam-B contains sequence families that were generated automatically by applying the Domainer algorithm to cluster and align the remaining protein sequences after removal of Pfam-A domains. By using Pfam, a large number of previously unannotated proteins from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project were classified. We have also identified many novel family memberships in known proteins, including new kazal, Fibronectin type III, and response regulator receiver domains. Pfam-A families have permanent accession numbers and form a library of HMMs available for searching and automatic annotation of new protein sequences.

  abstract = {A new method of comparing protein structures is described, based on distance plot analysis. It is relatively insensitive to insertions and deletions in sequence and is tolerant of the displacement of equivalent substructures between the two molecules being compared. When presented with the co-ordinate sets of two structures, the method will produce automatically an alignment of their sequences based on structural criteria. The method uses the dynamic programming optimization technique, which is widely used in the comparison of protein sequences and thus unifies the techniques of protein structure and sequence comparison. Typical structure comparison problems were examined and the results of the new method compared to the published results obtained using conventional methods. In most examples, the new method produced a result that was equivalent, and in some cases superior, to those reported in the literature.},
